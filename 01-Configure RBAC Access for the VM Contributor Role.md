# Configure RBAC Access for the VM Contributor Role

### Challenge Overview

## Understand the scenario

You are an IT manager who has a mandate to implement the principle of least privilege as a best practice whenever possible. You want to ensure that some members of your IT staff are able manage virtual machines, but cannot assign permissions to the machines or manage the underlying Azure fabric. You determine that the best way to accomplish this is to assign some members of your IT staff the built-in [Virtual Machine Contributor role](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-contributor) to create and manage virtual machines.

In this Challenge Lab, you will create an Azure virtual machine, assign the Virtual Machine Contributor role to an existing user, and then verify the role permissions.

## Understand your environment

You must created Azure account that contains a resource group named **RG-Challenge01**. You will use your user account like owner of subscription to create resources and assign role permissions, and then you must create other user account to test the role permissions, (You must record the new user account name and password, you will use it later.


# Create an Azure VM by using the Azure Cloud Shell

- Sign in to the Azure portal as your user account and password.

- Configure an Azure Cloud Shell **PowerShell** session by using the **RG-Challenge01cs** resource group (If not exists create it), a new storage account named **cloudshsa[your initials]** in the **East US** region, and a new file share named **shell**.

- Create a Windows Datacenter 2016 Azure VM by using the Azure Cloud Shell [New-AzVM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvm?view=azps-8.2.0) cmdlet and the information in the following table. For any property that is not specified, use the default value.

  | Property             | Value              |
  | -------------------- | ------------------ |
  | Resource group       | **RG-Challenge01** |
  | Virtual machine name | TestVM             |
  | Location             | East US            |
  | Vnet                 | **vnet**           |
  | Subnet Name          | **Subnet1**        |
  | Size                 | Standard_DS1_v2    |
  | User                 | student            |
  | Password             | AzurePassw0rd!     |


> Run the following Powershell Command to create a new Azure Virtual Machine in the **RG-Challenge01** resource group:
>
> ```
> New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "RG1lod28450521" -Location "East US" -Name "TestVM" -VirtualNetworkName "vnet" -SubnetName "Subnet1" -Size "Standard_DS1_v2"
> ```
>
> When prompted, enter student as the User and AzurePassw0rd! as the password for **TestVM**.
>
> Wait for the VM creation to complete.

## Check your work

- [ ] Confirm that you configured Azure Cloud Shell.
- [ ] Confirm that you created a virtual machine named **TestVM** by using Azure Cloud Shell.
